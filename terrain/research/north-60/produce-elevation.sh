# GDAL commands to produced fused DEMs in the vicinity of the 60N Canada
# boundary, using several "boundary-corrected" variants as well as the
# original uncorrected DEMs. Note that the multiresolution spline is not
# included here, because the associated fused layer is already produced
# in its entirety during that process.
